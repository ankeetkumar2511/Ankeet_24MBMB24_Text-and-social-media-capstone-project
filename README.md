4. User Engagement & Churn Prediction
    Random Forest model identifies at-risk users based on engagement metrics.
5. Sentiment Analysis
    Uses VADER NLP model to classify content mood as positive, negative, or neutral.

Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NLTK)
- Machine Learning, NLP, and Exploratory Data Analysis

Key Insights
